Harpoon was built as a demo for a Velocity (http://velocityconf.com/) workshop on the topic of 'automated web performance testing'. It was built to provide a way to store and analyze performance test results.

Building the project:
$ mvn -Prelease
* Inside the target dir you'll see a zip file and a tar.gz (e.g. 'target/harpoon-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz'). They contain the same thing, so use whichever format you prefer.

Running the project
* Install MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart)
  GOTCHA: make sure you create the default data directory (mkdir -p /data/db) if this is your first time using MongoDB
* Start mongod
* Unpack the archive to the directory where you want the Harpoon webapp to live
$ chmod u+x bin/harpoon // If you're running from *nix, you need to make the launch script executable
* Inside the bin directory there are two files: harpoon and harpoon.bat.
  If you're running on win, execute harpoon.bat.
  If you're running on *nix, execute harpoon (sh harpoon)
* Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

What? No web.xml?
We're using maven appassembler and assembly plugins to package everything into a format that can be started directly, without the need to set up an external servlet container (we embed Jetty).
